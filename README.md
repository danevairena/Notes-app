## About the Project  
Notes-app is a lightweight react application that allows users to create, edit and delete notes in a clean and intuitive interface. Built with React, this project demonstrates my ability to take a concept through UI/UX design to a fully functioning front-end.

---

## My Role & Goals  
As the sole developer and designer of the project, I aimed to:
- Design a minimalist and user-friendly interface for note taking  
- Implement core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality  
- Ensure responsiveness and efficient state management  
- Deploy the app via GitHub Pages for easy access

---

## Tech Stack  
- React.js  
- HTML5 & CSS3 (and optionally any CSS module/library you used)  
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

---

## Key Features  
- Create new notes with title & content  
- Edit and delete existing notes  
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile  
- Intuitive user experience with clean design  
- (If applicable) Storage of notes in browser (localStorage) or other persistence mechanism
